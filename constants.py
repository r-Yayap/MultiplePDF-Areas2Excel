1. Select the folder containing PDF & DWG files.

3. It will generate an Excel report comparing filenames:
   ‚Ä¢ Matching filenames will be on the same row
   ‚Ä¢ Missing = empty
   ‚Ä¢ Duplicates will be shown on the last columns
   ‚Ä¢ Includes file sizes, modified dates, and relative folders."""

The BIM File Checker scans a folder and visually shows in Excel:
    -Which file types are present (RVT, IFC, DWG, etc.)
    -Which ones are missing
    -Which files are duplicated
It creates a clear table so you can quickly spot what's complete and what is missing.

How to use it?

1. Select the directory containing your BIM-related files (RVT, IFC, NWD, etc.).

2. Once the folder is selected, save the output somewhere.

3. It generates an Excel report highlighting:
   ‚Ä¢ ‚úì Green    - File type found
   ‚Ä¢ Black      - Empty (missing) types
   ‚Ä¢ Red        - Duplicate file names for the same type

    - First row will be treated as a header and will not be included in renaming
    - Original Filename should be on the FIRST column
    - New Filename should be on the second column
    - Do not forget the file format for both column!
    
2. Select the root folder where files are located.

4. Click ‚ÄúStart Rename‚Äù to apply the changes.
